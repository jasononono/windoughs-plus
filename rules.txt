IMPORTANT STUFF
---------------

- the 'requirement.txt' file specifies the required packages and libraries needed to run Windoughs. Upon running '__main__.py', Windoughs will automatically install the missing packages via pip3. If one wishes to skip the dependency check, or to manually perform the installation, simply delete 'requirement.txt'.

--------------------------------
FILE MANAGEMENT AND ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------

- every directory (excluding 'Storage' and '.dough' applications) should have 'info.json' that lists its visibility and other information. (Windoughs can handle exceptions where 'info.json' is not found, however, this is not recommended.)

- applications must be python modules with extension '.dough', otherwise Windoughs will not recognize it as a valid "executable." Within the '.dough' directory, there must be a '__init__.py' file, which Windoughs will execute upon opening the program.
